title: Local Dev Admin
---

> [!CAUTION]
> Every credential on this page is committed to this repo and indexed by every search engine. Anyone who can reach a server with the seed loaded has admin. **Only run `pnpm db:seed` against a database your laptop is the only thing that can talk to.** Never against staging, never against a "throwaway" cloud DB, never against anything bound to a public IP. The script's guards (`SEED_SAFE=1`, hostname allowlist) are a backstop, not a substitute for that rule.

The seeded local-dev admin account:

| Field    | Value                |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| Email    | `admin@example.test` |
| Password | `SeedPass123!`       |
| Role     | `admin`              |

This user only exists after you've run the seed against your local DB. The seed script ([scripts/seed.ts](https://github.com/shawnphoffman/giftwrapt/blob/main/scripts/seed.ts)) is the source of truth - if the credentials here drift from the script, the script wins.

## Creating (or Recreating) It

```bash
SEED_SAFE=1 pnpm db:seed
```

> [!WARNING]
> `db:seed` **truncates everything first** - users, lists, items, sessions, accounts, verifications, the lot. The script refuses to run unless `DATABASE_URL` points at a known-local host (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `host.docker.internal`, `postgres`, `db`) AND `SEED_SAFE=1` is set, so it can't clobber a remote DB by accident. But it absolutely will clobber your local one. Don't run it against a DB whose contents you care about.

## Other Seeded Users

All share the password `SeedPass123!`:

| Email                | Role  | Notes                                                   |
| -------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `admin@example.test` | admin | Owns the kitchen-sink showcase list                     |
| `alice@example.test` | user  | Partnered with Bob; guardian of Kid + Teen              |
| `bob@example.test`   | user  | Partnered with Alice; guardian of Kid + Teen            |
| `carol@example.test` | user  | Solo; mutual view-only with Alice and Eve               |
| `dave@example.test`  | user  | Partnered with Eve                                      |
| `eve@example.test`   | user  | Partnered with Dave; owns a gifter-perspective showcase |
| `frank@example.test` | user  | Isolated, no relationships (verifies private case)      |
| `grace@example.test` | user  | Only sees admin's showcase                              |
| `kid@example.test`   | child | Guardians Alice + Bob                                   |
| `teen@example.test`  | child | Guardians Alice + Bob                                   |

## Regaining Access Without Reseeding

If the admin record got wiped but you want to keep everything else intact, use the break-glass CLIs instead of `db:seed`:

```bash
# Create a new admin (fails if the email already exists).
pnpm admin:create \
  --email=admin@example.test \
  --password='SeedPass123!' \
  --name='Admin'

# Reset the password on an existing account.
# Also revokes all that user's active sessions.
pnpm admin:reset-password \
  --email=admin@example.test \
  --password='SeedPass123!'
```

These CLIs have **no** env guard - their authentication barrier is "you have shell access to the process." They're safe to run against any DB; point `DATABASE_URL` at whichever one you mean to touch. See the doc comments at the top of [scripts/admin-create.ts](https://github.com/shawnphoffman/giftwrapt/blob/main/scripts/admin-create.ts) and [scripts/admin-reset-password.ts](https://github.com/shawnphoffman/giftwrapt/blob/main/scripts/admin-reset-password.ts) for details.

## Fresh Deployments (No Seed)

On a fresh deploy with an empty DB, seeding isn't appropriate. Instead, the first-admin bootstrap in [src/lib/auth.ts](https://github.com/shawnphoffman/giftwrapt/blob/main/src/lib/auth.ts) promotes the first user who signs up to `admin`. If that's not workable (e.g. you want a specific email, or the DB isn't actually empty), exec into the container and run the bundled CLI: `node .output/scripts/admin-create.mjs` or `node .output/scripts/admin-reset-password.mjs`, with the same flags shown above. The runtime image ships those bundles rather than pnpm and `node_modules`, so the `pnpm admin:*` form only works from a source checkout. See [Self-hosting](/deploy/self-hosting/#admin-cli).
