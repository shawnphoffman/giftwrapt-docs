title: Storage

GiftWrapt stores user avatars and item photos in an S3-compatible bucket. The app never cares which backend you use: any service that speaks the S3 API works. Pick a recipe below, fill in the `STORAGE_*` env vars, and restart the app.

  STORAGE_PUBLIC_URL set:     STORAGE_PUBLIC_URL unset:
  ${PUBLIC_URL}/<key>          /api/files/<key> (proxied via GetObject)
```

- Uploads go through the app server. Sharp transcodes to webp (256x256 cover for avatars, 1200px long edge for items) before writing to storage.
- Public URLs are either direct (when `STORAGE_PUBLIC_URL` is set) or proxied through `/api/files/*` (the default).
- Keys embed a nanoid suffix so every upload produces a new immutable URL, safe to cache aggressively.

## Local dev

Docker Compose boots Postgres plus exactly one S3-compatible storage backend, picked via Compose profiles. Pick one and stick with it for that checkout; running both at once works but wastes resources. Idempotent init steps mean re-running is harmless.

### Option A: Garage

A separate `pnpm storage:init` step assigns the cluster layout, creates the bucket, and imports your keys via Garage's admin HTTP API.

**Set in `.env.local` (for `pnpm dev`) AND `.env` (for `docker compose`):**

```env
STORAGE_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3900   # .env uses http://garage:3900 instead
STORAGE_REGION=garage
STORAGE_BUCKET=giftwrapt
STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID=GK$(openssl rand -hex 12)
STORAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
STORAGE_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=true

# Only used by `pnpm storage:init` and the bundled Garage daemon:
GARAGE_ADMIN_URL=http://localhost:3903    # where storage:init reaches the daemon
GARAGE_ADMIN_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
GARAGE_RPC_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
```

Garage is picky about credential formats: key IDs must start with `GK` followed by exactly 24 hex chars; secrets must be 64 hex chars. AWS/R2 don't care, but Garage will reject anything shorter or non-hex.

**Boot the stack:**

```bash
docker compose --profile garage up -d   # starts postgres + garage daemon
pnpm storage:init                       # one-shot: layout assign, bucket create, key import
pnpm dev                                # start the app
```

**Inspect your bucket:**

```bash
# List objects:
docker compose --profile garage exec garage /garage bucket info giftwrapt
# Drop all state and start fresh:
docker compose --profile garage down -v
```

### Option B: RustFS (MinIO-compatible drop-in)

RustFS provisions root credentials at startup from env vars, so the bootstrap is just a `HeadBucket` / `CreateBucket` call. No admin token, no separate config file, no cluster layout. Credentials can be any string (no `GK` prefix, no hex requirement).

**Set in `.env.local` (and `.env` if `docker compose` reads them):**

```env
STORAGE_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9000   # .env uses http://rustfs:9000 instead
STORAGE_REGION=us-east-1
STORAGE_BUCKET=giftwrapt
STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID=local-dev-key
STORAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=local-dev-secret
STORAGE_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=true
```

**Boot the stack:**

```bash
docker compose --profile rustfs up -d   # starts postgres + rustfs
pnpm storage:init:rustfs                # one-shot bucket-create
pnpm dev                                # start the app
```

**Inspect your bucket:** RustFS exposes a web console at <http://localhost:9001>. Log in with the same access key id and secret you set above.

## Self-host (Garage)

Same stack, production-grade compose file. Garage runs inside the compose network; port 3900 is not exposed by default. The app serves images through `/api/files/*`, so clients never need direct bucket access.

The giftwrapt container bootstraps Garage automatically on every cold boot when `INIT_GARAGE=true` (the compose default). The init step runs once via Garage's admin HTTP API (layout assign, bucket create, key import, permission grant), then proceeds to DB migrations and server start. Idempotent: on subsequent boots each step short-circuits when it finds its target already in place.

```bash
cp env.example docker/.env
# Edit docker/.env: set STORAGE_* (same constraints as above) plus GARAGE_RPC_SECRET
# and GARAGE_ADMIN_TOKEN. INIT_GARAGE defaults to "true" in the compose file;
# override to "false" only if you're swapping Garage out for external S3.
docker compose -f docker/compose.selfhost-garage.yaml up -d
```

**Exposing Garage directly (optional, faster):** if you front the server with nginx or Caddy, you can offload image bandwidth to a CDN by pointing `STORAGE_PUBLIC_URL` at a reverse-proxied Garage endpoint.

```nginx
# nginx snippet
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name s3.example.com;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3900;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }
}
```

```env
STORAGE_PUBLIC_URL=https://s3.example.com/giftwrapt
```

Expose port 3900 in `docker/compose.selfhost-garage.yaml` (`ports: - "3900:3900"`) and restart.

**Rotating credentials:** Garage tombstones deleted keys so the same `STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID` cannot be reused once removed. To rotate, pick a new ID+secret, run `docker compose down -v` (this wipes the Garage data volume and all stored images) and `up` again. If you already have real uploads you want to keep, use `garage key import` manually with a new ID.

## Self-host (RustFS)

Same architecture as the Garage recipe, but the bundled storage sidecar is RustFS instead of Garage. Pick this if you want a MinIO-compatible drop-in with simpler bootstrap; pick the Garage variant if you already have a working stack and prefer zero churn. Don't run both at once - they share the same `app` and `postgres` services.

The bootstrap is a single `HeadBucket` / `CreateBucket` call against the regular S3 endpoint - no admin API, no admin token, no key import, no permission grant. RustFS reads its root credentials at startup from `RUSTFS_ACCESS_KEY` / `RUSTFS_SECRET_KEY`, which the compose file plumbs through from `STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `STORAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. Credentials can be arbitrary strings - no `GK` prefix, no hex constraint.

```bash
cp env.example docker/.env
# Edit docker/.env: set STORAGE_ENDPOINT=http://rustfs:9000, STORAGE_REGION=us-east-1,
# STORAGE_BUCKET=giftwrapt, plus any STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID and
# STORAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY values, and STORAGE_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=true.
# INIT_RUSTFS defaults to "true" in the compose file; override to "false"
# only if you're swapping RustFS out for external S3.
docker compose -f docker/compose.selfhost-rustfs.yaml up -d
```

**Web console:** RustFS exposes a management console on port 9001. The compose file does not bind it to the host by default (only the compose network can reach it). To enable GUI access, add `ports: - "9001:9001"` to the `rustfs` service - and put it behind a reverse proxy with auth, or restrict the host port to `127.0.0.1:9001` for SSH-tunnel-only access. The console authenticates with the same `STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `STORAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` pair, so changing the defaults in `.env` is mandatory before any public exposure.

**Maturity caveats:** RustFS markets distributed (multi-node) mode as "Under Testing" upstream. The bundled stack is single-node, which is fully supported - just don't expect to scale horizontally yet. The project is younger than Garage; pin to a specific image tag (`rustfs/rustfs:1.0.0` or similar) rather than `:latest` if you want stable upgrade behavior.

**Rotating credentials:** unlike Garage, RustFS has no tombstone behavior. Change the `STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `STORAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` values in `.env`, restart the stack, and the new credentials take effect on the next RustFS boot. Existing objects remain accessible since the bucket itself is unchanged.

## Vercel + Cloudflare R2

R2 is the cheapest S3-compatible option for Vercel: no egress charges and a free tier that covers this app's traffic.

1. Create a bucket in the R2 dashboard (any name; used as `STORAGE_BUCKET`).
2. **R2 → Manage R2 API Tokens → Create API token → Object Read & Write**. Scope it to your bucket.
3. Note the "Account ID" (for the endpoint) and the generated Access Key ID + Secret.
4. In Vercel project settings → Environment Variables, add:

```env
STORAGE_ENDPOINT=https://<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
STORAGE_REGION=auto
STORAGE_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<R2 token id>
STORAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<R2 token secret>
STORAGE_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=false
STORAGE_PUBLIC_URL=https://<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/<bucket>
```

For a custom domain (recommended, uses R2's free CDN): **R2 → Bucket → Settings → Custom Domains**, point a subdomain at the bucket, then set `STORAGE_PUBLIC_URL=https://cdn.example.com`.

**Why leave the default unset?** When `STORAGE_PUBLIC_URL` is absent, every image load hits a Vercel Function to proxy from storage. That's a function invocation per thumbnail, which burns your quota fast. Setting it points clients at R2 directly. The app still works either way; the env var is purely an optimization.

## Vercel + AWS S3

Functionally identical to R2 but with AWS's IAM model. You'll want a narrow-scoped IAM policy so the app key can only touch its own bucket:

```json
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": ["s3:PutObject", "s3:GetObject", "s3:DeleteObject"],
			"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
		},
		{
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": "s3:ListBucket",
			"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name"
		}
	]
}
```

```env
STORAGE_ENDPOINT=https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
STORAGE_REGION=us-east-1
STORAGE_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA...
STORAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
STORAGE_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=false
STORAGE_PUBLIC_URL=https://d123.cloudfront.net
```

Put CloudFront in front of the bucket and set `STORAGE_PUBLIC_URL` to the distribution domain. Without CloudFront the bucket needs public-read ACLs or presigned URLs; neither is recommended.

## Vercel + Supabase Storage

A natural fit if you already run Postgres on Supabase: the same project exposes an S3-compatible gateway, so storage and DB share one dashboard and one bill.

1. **Supabase dashboard → Storage → New bucket.** Mark it public if you want direct-URL serving; leave it private to proxy through `/api/files/*`.
2. **Storage → S3 Connection.** Note the endpoint URL and region shown there.
3. **Storage → S3 Access Keys → New access key.** Copy the access key ID and secret (the secret is shown once).
4. In Vercel project settings → Environment Variables, add:

```env
STORAGE_ENDPOINT=https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/storage/v1/s3
STORAGE_REGION=<region from S3 Connection panel>
STORAGE_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<Supabase S3 access key id>
STORAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<Supabase S3 secret>
STORAGE_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=true
STORAGE_PUBLIC_URL=https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/<bucket>
```

- Use the **S3 access keys** from Storage settings, not the project anon or service-role JWTs. Those are different credentials and won't authenticate against the S3 endpoint.
- Supabase requires `STORAGE_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=true`; it does not support virtual-hosted-style bucket addressing.
- For private buckets, omit `STORAGE_PUBLIC_URL` and let the `/api/files/*` proxy serve images. Same Vercel-function cost caveat as the R2 recipe: every thumbnail becomes a function invocation.
- For a custom CDN domain, point a Supabase custom domain (or any reverse proxy) at the public-object path and set `STORAGE_PUBLIC_URL` to that hostname.

Default is off; the RustFS self-host compose file sets it to true. Ignored for external S3 deploys. Don't set both `INIT_GARAGE` and `INIT_RUSTFS`.         |

## Troubleshooting

**`storage.init.failed` on boot, HeadBucket 403/404.** Credentials or endpoint wrong, or the bucket doesn't exist yet. On compose self-host, the app's own entrypoint logs the Garage bootstrap steps before the storage boot plugin runs - check `docker compose logs app` for `[init-garage]` lines to see which step failed. On Vercel, verify the env vars match your R2/S3 dashboard; mismatched region or wrong `STORAGE_FORCE_PATH_STYLE` for the provider both surface as 403s.

**Uploads succeed but images 404 on render.** `STORAGE_PUBLIC_URL` is set to something the browser can't reach. Either unset it (falls back to the `/api/files/*` proxy), point it at a reachable CDN domain, or expose Garage through a reverse proxy and use that URL.

**Images load on Vercel but 404 on self-host.** Garage isn't exposed to the public internet and you set `STORAGE_PUBLIC_URL` anyway. Unset it and let the proxy handle it.

**`[init-garage] failed: Garage admin API ... did not become healthy`.** The app container can't reach the Garage daemon's admin port. Check that the `garage` service is healthy (`docker compose ps`) and that `GARAGE_ADMIN_URL` matches the service name in your compose file. If Garage is still booting, the 60-second wait should cover it; retry the app container if the daemon came up after the app.

**`[init-garage] failed: POST /v1/key/import failed: 409`.** Garage tombstones deleted keys, and a prior run's key cannot be re-imported. You shouldn't hit this on a normal boot because the bootstrap checks for duplicates before importing, but if it surfaces: pick a new `STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID` in your `.env`, or `docker compose down -v` to wipe all Garage state.

**`[init-rustfs] failed: storage endpoint ... did not become reachable`.** The app container can't reach the RustFS S3 port (9000) within 60 seconds. Check that the `rustfs` service is running (`docker compose ps`) and that `STORAGE_ENDPOINT` in `.env` matches the service hostname (`http://rustfs:9000` for the self-host compose file). Check `docker compose logs rustfs` for startup errors; mismatched volume permissions are the most common cause - the container runs as UID 10001 and needs write access to `/data` and `/logs`.

**Sharp missing from `.output/server/node_modules/sharp` after `pnpm build`.** Nitro's externals config didn't trace it. Confirm `traceDeps: ['sharp']` is present in `vite.config.ts`. If Docker build still fails, add `COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules/sharp ./.output/server/node_modules/sharp` to the runtime stage as a belt-and-suspenders.

## Backup and GC

The admin data export at `src/api/backup.ts` covers DB rows only. Bucket contents are separate and use the provider's own backup story:

- **Garage:** `garage bucket snapshot` is not yet in v1.0.1; for now, back up the `garage_data` volume directly (`docker run --rm -v giftwrapt-dev_garage_data:/data alpine tar -czf- -C /data .`).
- **RustFS:** back up the `rustfs_data` volume directly (`docker run --rm -v <project>_rustfs_data:/data alpine tar -czf- -C /data .`). Or use the AWS CLI / `mc` against the S3 endpoint to mirror objects to a remote bucket.
- **R2:** versioning is on by default; enable lifecycle rules in the R2 dashboard.
- **AWS S3:** enable bucket versioning + lifecycle rules.

Orphaned objects (from interrupted deletes) aren't currently swept; a `scripts/storage-gc.ts` tool is a planned follow-up.
