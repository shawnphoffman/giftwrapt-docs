title: URL scraping
---

When you paste a product URL into the add-item dialog, GiftWrapt scrapes it for a title, description, photo, price, and currency. This page covers how that pipeline works, what knobs the admin has, and how to plug in your own scraper.

## Tiers

Each configured entry has a `tier` (1-5). The orchestrator runs tier 1's entries in parallel, merges their results, and only advances to tier 2 if the merged score fell below `scrapeQualityThreshold`. Same for tier 2 → tier 3, etc.

The always-on `fetch-provider` is implicit tier 0; it runs first, alone. The `ai-provider` is a parallel racer that fires alongside the tier loop and competes via final scoring.

**Why tiers:** cost control. Put cheap stuff in tier 1 (browserless, custom HTTP) and paid hosted services in tier 2 / 3. Pages where tier 1 already gets a usable result never spend money on Browserbase or ScrapFly.

Default tier on new entries:

- `browserless`, `flaresolverr`, `custom-http`, `giftwrapt-scraper` → tier 1
- `browserbase-fetch`, `scrapfly` → tier 2
- `browserbase-stagehand` → tier 3

The admin tunes from `/admin/scraping` via the Tier dropdown on each card.

## Merging within a tier

When a tier has multiple entries that all succeed, the orchestrator does **fill-the-gaps merging** before scoring:

- Sort contributions by per-provider score (descending). The highest-scoring result is the "base."
- For each scalar field (`title`, `description`, `price`, `currency`, `siteName`, `finalUrl`) that the base left empty, fill from runners-up in score order. First non-empty wins.
- `imageUrls` always concatenates and dedupes across all contributors.
- Re-score the merged result. If it now clears `scrapeQualityThreshold`, the tier wins and later tiers don't fire.

The merged result is persisted with `scraperId: 'merged:a,b,c'` so the admin can trace which providers contributed. `/admin/scrapes` renders that as `Provider A + Provider B (merged)`.

Implementation: [src/lib/scrapers/merge.ts](https://github.com/shawnphoffman/giftwrapt/blob/main/src/lib/scrapers/merge.ts). Mirrors the same priority-fill pattern the local extractor uses across its OG / JSON-LD / Microdata / Heuristics layers.

## Provider types

Configured in `/admin/scraping` (DB-backed `appSettings.scrapeProviders`, with secret fields encrypted at rest). The admin can add multiple entries of the same type (e.g. two Browserless instances) and drag to reorder within a tier; the Tier dropdown moves an entry between tiers.

| type                    | mode         | secret fields   | best for                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `browserless`           | sequential   | `token`         | self-hosted JS rendering                          |
| `flaresolverr`          | sequential   | -               | self-hosted Cloudflare bypass                     |
| `browserbase-fetch`     | sequential   | `apiKey`        | hosted JS rendering, no LLM                       |
| `browserbase-stagehand` | **parallel** | `apiKey`        | hosted structured extraction with LLM             |
| `scrapfly`              | sequential   | `apiKey`        | hosted scraping with optional anti-bot / JS       |
| `giftwrapt-scraper`     | sequential   | `token`         | self-hosted facade chaining several backends      |
| `custom-http`           | sequential   | `customHeaders` | bring-your-own scraper service                    |
| `ai-provider`           | **parallel** | -               | extracts directly from raw HTML (admin AI config) |

Plus the always-on built-in:

| id               | mode       | gates on |
| ---------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| `fetch-provider` | sequential | -        |

Default chain order: `fetch → [scrapeProviders in admin-controlled order] → ai`.

## Decision tree: which provider next?

- Vanilla page, OG tags, no JS gating → **fetch-provider** is enough.
- Empty body unless JS runs (Shopify-on-React, custom SPAs) → add a **browserless** entry (self-host) or **browserbase-fetch** (hosted).
- Cloudflare challenge / Turnstile in front of the page → add a **flaresolverr** entry (self-host).
- Bot-detection-heavy sites (Amazon, retailers with aggressive WAFs) → **scrapfly** with `asp=true`, or **giftwrapt-scraper** if you self-host the facade.
- You already operate a scraper somewhere → **custom-http** in `/admin/scraping`. JSON mode validates against `ScrapeResult`; HTML mode goes through the local extractor.
- The page is consistently weird, the chain keeps falling through, and even the cheap `ai-provider` (which extracts from raw HTML) misses → add a **browserbase-stagehand** entry; it spins up a real browser session and uses Stagehand's `extract()` to pull a structured ScrapeResult. Slow and LLM-billable; runs in parallel.

## Config keys (`appSettings`)

| key                          | default | what                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `scrapeProviderTimeoutMs`    | 10000   | per-provider HTTP budget                    |
| `scrapeOverallTimeoutMs`     | 20000   | overall scrape budget incl. parallel racers |
| `scrapeQualityThreshold`     | 3       | score needed to short-circuit the chain     |
| `scrapeCacheTtlHours`        | 24      | URL-based dedup cache TTL (0 = disable)     |
| `scrapeProviders`            | `[]`    | discriminated array of typed entries        |
| `scrapeAiProviderEnabled`    | `false` | flips the parallel AI scraper on            |
| `scrapeAiCleanTitlesEnabled` | `false` | post-pass: AI normalises the winning title  |

The AI client config (provider type / model / api key) lives next to the scraping AI toggles under `/admin/ai`; both AI features read from it.

### First-boot env-var seeds

On first server start after upgrading, if no entry of type `browserless` exists yet AND `BROWSERLESS_URL` is set, the bootstrap inserts a corresponding entry. Same for `FLARESOLVERR_URL`. After that, the admin owns the configuration and the env vars are unused. New deploys should configure everything via `/admin/scraping`.

```
# Optional first-boot seed values; do NOT add new vars here for new deploys.
BROWSERLESS_URL=...
BROWSER_TOKEN=...
FLARESOLVERR_URL=...
```

## SSRF protection

Authenticated users supply the URL, so the scraper has to refuse to fetch addresses inside our own infrastructure. Both the always-on `fetch-provider` and the AI provider go through [`safeFetch`](https://github.com/shawnphoffman/giftwrapt/blob/main/src/lib/scrapers/safe-fetch.ts), which:

- rejects non-`http(s)` schemes,
- DNS-resolves the hostname (`dns.lookup` with `all: true`) and rejects any address in a private, loopback, link-local, CGNAT, multicast, or reserved range (full list lives in the module),
- walks redirects manually (`redirect: 'manual'`) and re-runs the same check on every hop, so a public host that 30x's to `127.0.0.1` is rejected at the redirect rather than followed,
- caps the redirect chain (default 5),
- sets `credentials: 'omit'`.

Hosted providers (Browserbase, ScrapFly, browserless, flaresolverr, giftwrapt-scraper, custom-http) make their own outbound calls from outside our infra, so they don't need the same hostname check on the user-supplied URL - their upstream services apply their own rules. They DO go through admin-configured endpoints, which the orchestrator does not validate against this list.

## Encryption at rest

Secret fields on `scrapeProviders` entries are AES-256-GCM-encrypted in `app_settings` JSONB using the same envelope helpers (`encryptAppSecret` / `decryptAppSecret`) that already protect the AI and Resend API keys. The master key is derived via scrypt from `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`. New writes encrypt; reads accept either an envelope or legacy plaintext, so an upgrade is a no-op until the admin next saves an entry.

## Stagehand: optional dependency

`@browserbasehq/stagehand` is declared under `optionalDependencies` in `package.json`. Default `pnpm install` pulls it in; deploys that don't need Stagehand can `pnpm install --no-optional` to skip it (and skip the transitive `playwright-core` it pulls in). The provider also dynamically imports the SDK only when its `fetch()` method runs, so configurations where no Stagehand entry is enabled never load the heavy module.

## Deployment matrix

| scenario                                 | working chain                                 | notes                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Vercel, no extras                        | `fetch-provider` only                         | Best-effort. Hard sites return a clean failure so the form prompts for manual entry. |
| Vercel + Browserbase Fetch API           | `fetch → browserbase-fetch`                   | Hosted JS rendering, paste API key in `/admin/scraping`. Cheapest hosted upgrade.    |
| Vercel + ScrapFly                        | `fetch → scrapfly`                            | Hosted with anti-bot bypass via `asp=true`. Pay per credit.                          |
| Vercel + Browserbase Fetch + Stagehand   | `fetch → browserbase-fetch → ai \| stagehand` | Stagehand races in parallel; wins when the cheap chain returns thin data.            |
| Vercel + custom HTTP scraper             | `fetch → custom-http`                         | Cheapest way to get JS rendering on Vercel without paying a hosted vendor.           |
| Self-hosted (containers)                 | full chain incl. browserless + flaresolverr   | Run them as sidecar containers behind the same reverse proxy.                        |
| AI extraction on top of any of the above | adds `ai-provider` as a parallel racer        | Off by default. Costs money.                                                         |

## Where things live

- Server: [src/lib/scrapers/](https://github.com/shawnphoffman/giftwrapt/blob/main/src/lib/scrapers/) - orchestrator, types, extractor, scoring, cache, providers, post-passes, sse-format.
- Provider dispatcher: [src/lib/scrapers/providers/load-configured.ts](https://github.com/shawnphoffman/giftwrapt/blob/main/src/lib/scrapers/providers/load-configured.ts) reads `appSettings.scrapeProviders` and instantiates a `ScrapeProvider` per enabled entry via type-specific factories.
- Bootstrap env-seed: [src/db/bootstrap.ts](https://github.com/shawnphoffman/giftwrapt/blob/main/src/db/bootstrap.ts) - one-shot seed of browserless/flaresolverr entries from env on first boot.
- Routes: [src/routes/api/scrape/stream.ts](https://github.com/shawnphoffman/giftwrapt/blob/main/src/routes/api/scrape/stream.ts) (the SSE entry point) and [src/api/scraper.ts](https://github.com/shawnphoffman/giftwrapt/blob/main/src/api/scraper.ts) (the non-streaming server fn).
- Schema: `itemScrapes` in [src/db/schema/items.ts](https://github.com/shawnphoffman/giftwrapt/blob/main/src/db/schema/items.ts) - one row per attempt, `itemId` is nullable so the form's prefill flow can scrape a URL before an item exists.
- Client: [src/lib/use-scrape-url.ts](https://github.com/shawnphoffman/giftwrapt/blob/main/src/lib/use-scrape-url.ts) (state-machine hook), [src/components/items/scrape-progress-alert.tsx](https://github.com/shawnphoffman/giftwrapt/blob/main/src/components/items/scrape-progress-alert.tsx) (live progress UX), [src/components/items/image-picker.tsx](https://github.com/shawnphoffman/giftwrapt/blob/main/src/components/items/image-picker.tsx) (post-scrape image swap).
- Admin: `src/components/admin/scraper-providers-form*` and `src/components/admin/ai-scraping-section*`.

## Adding a new provider type

1. Add a discriminated variant to `scrapeProviderEntrySchema` in [src/lib/settings.ts](https://github.com/shawnphoffman/giftwrapt/blob/main/src/lib/settings.ts). Mark any secret fields with `appSecretField()`.
2. If a new secret field type is added, also include it in `encryptScrapeProviderSecrets` so the write path encrypts it.
3. Create `src/lib/scrapers/providers/<id>.ts` exporting a `create<Id>Provider(entry)` factory. `kind: 'html'` plus the shared extractor is the cheapest path; only go `kind: 'structured'` when the upstream service genuinely returns structured fields you trust.
4. Choose `mode: 'sequential'` unless the provider is independent enough to race (`ai-provider` and `browserbase-stagehand` are parallel).
5. `isAvailable()` should be a cheap entry-level check - the chain filters before fetching.
6. Wire the new factory into `loadConfiguredProviders()`'s switch in [src/lib/scrapers/providers/load-configured.ts](https://github.com/shawnphoffman/giftwrapt/blob/main/src/lib/scrapers/providers/load-configured.ts).
7. Add a card component in `src/components/admin/scraper-providers-form-view.tsx` for the type, plus a default-entry shape in `makeDefaultEntry()`.
8. Add a fixture test under `__tests__/` covering the success path plus each error code your provider can throw.

## Things to keep in mind

- Errors classify into a small enum (`bot_block`, `http_4xx`, `http_5xx`, `network_error`, `timeout`, `invalid_response`, `config_missing`, `unknown`). Use `ScrapeProviderError` so the orchestrator surfaces the right wire code in the streaming UX.
- The cache short-circuits before any provider runs. `force: true` on `scrapeUrl({...})` (or `?force=true` on the SSE route) bypasses it.
- Don't clobber user input. The add-item form tracks per-field "user touched" refs and skips prefill when the user has typed in a field.
- Per-provider timeouts (10s default) are independent of the overall budget (20s default). Both are tunable in `/admin/scraping`.
- The orchestrator emits a single SSE event stream; the client `useScrapeUrl` reduces it into a 5-state machine. If you add a new event type, add it to `StreamEvent` in `types.ts` and to the reducer in `use-scrape-url.ts`.
